Extract the supplier name and all line items from the document.
The output MUST be a single valid JSON object. Do NOT include any text outside of the JSON object.
The JSON object should conform to the following schema:
{
    "supplier_name": "The full legal name of the primary supplier, vendor, or service provider. String or null if not identifiable.",
    "items": [
        // This MUST be a JSON array of item objects.
        // If no items/services are found, use an empty array: [].
        // Do NOT include a trailing comma after the last item object in this array.
        {
            "description": "The complete and exact name or description of the item, service, or product. CRITICAL: Normalize the description by removing excessive internal and surrounding spaces. Standardize common punctuation: ALL hyphens (-) used to connect words or parts of a description MUST NOT have adjacent spaces (e.g., 'Extra-Support-Module' NOT 'Extra - Support - Module'; 'Användarstöd-Agda' NOT 'Användarstöd - Agda'). Use slashes (/) without adjacent spaces (e.g., 'Web/Cloud' NOT 'Web / Cloud'). The description MUST NOT include quantity, units (e.g., 'st', 'pcs', 'ärende'), pricing, or totals; these belong in their respective fields. String.",
            "quantity": "The numerical quantity of the item. Default to 1.0 if not specified, unclear, or not applicable (e.g., for a general service or lump sum). Must be a Number.",
            "unit_price": "The numerical price per unit of the item or service. Extract the actual price value. NEVER use 0 unless the document explicitly states the price is zero. Must be a Number.",
            "total": "The total numerical price for this specific line item (quantity * unit_price). If explicitly stated, use that value. If not, it may be calculated or extracted if present. Must be a Number."
        }
        // ... more items if present
    ]
}

If a value is not found or cannot be determined, use `null` for string fields and ensure numeric fields are actual numbers or handle them appropriately if they must be omitted based on instructions (though the schema implies they are required or defaulted).
For "items", if the document contains no line items, services, or products, the value for "items" MUST be an empty array `[]`.
Ensure all monetary values are extracted as numbers (e.g., 123.45, not "123.45 USD").
The "description" for each item should be as complete and exact as possible, following the normalization rules above.
The "quantity" should be a number; if not specified or not applicable, default to 1.0.
The "unit_price" should be a number.
The "total" for each line item should be a number.
